# Ames-Housing-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction
This is my notebook for analyzing and predicting the Ames housing Dataset.
In this Project, we explore how the asset value relates to different features present in Ames dataset.

Analyzed and predicted the asset value relating to different features present in the Ames housing Dataset. Performed various analysis techniques to find interesting observations about the data. Also, applied techniques like log-transformation, removing outliers, making models robust against outliers, feature selection, feature engineering, label encoding and modelling to improve the performance of linear regression models on Ames dataset.
